This was a full redesign of capachione.com, the website for a local school of performing arts. The prior website, built in Wix, was no longer serving the needs of the organization, so I was tasked with a complete redesign and redevelop of the website.

The new website is a custom design, built in WordPress on the Avada theme. The site is designed to allow for easy content management and updates by non-technical users on the client side.
