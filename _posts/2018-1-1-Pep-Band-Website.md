This project was a full redesign of the website for the Northeastern Pep Band.

The site has two main functions. It's first and most important purpose is to draw in potential new members, provide them with any information they may be interested in, and tell them how to join. It's secondary purpose is to host various content that is regularly accessed by current members such as various forms, information about membership requirements, and a calendar of events. The site runs on Wordpress and is based on the Sydney theme by aThemes.

The layout, content, logos, and graphics were all created by me, following the design guidelines of Northeastern Athletics. The site was also set up to be easily editable by others, as it has now passed from me to the next webmaster of the pep band.
