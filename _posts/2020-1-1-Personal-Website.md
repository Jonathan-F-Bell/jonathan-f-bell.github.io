The website you're on right now!

I built this site from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Javascript on top of Jekyll.

The site is designed to be lightweight, fully responsive, and accessible. It will respond to any display size, has 3 color themes which follow the theme of the user's system, obeys the reduce motion setting, has fallbacks in place for when javascript is disabled, and is fully tab navigable.

The site earns 100/100 in performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO from Google's Lighthouse audit.
