In Interaction Design 1 we took a web based project through the stages of design, from conception to a high fidelity prototype.
My project, Kin, was a chat client for families.
Below is a PDF of the final presentation I gave for this project. Interactive Adobe XD prototypes and further process documentation available on request.
