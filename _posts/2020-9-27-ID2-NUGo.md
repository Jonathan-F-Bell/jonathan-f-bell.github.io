This was the first project for my Interaction Design 2 class, in which we redesigned an existing app with bad UI/UX. For this project we chose a bad app and good examples, created flow diagrams of each, and then used that research to create a redesign of the original app.

I chose to work with NUGo, Northeastern University's student app which has not been updated in many years. In the course of this redesign, I focused on simplifying the interface to include only the features necessary for students when they needed them and on following the native design guidelines of the iOS and Android platforms.

Below is a PDF of the final presentation I gave for this project. Interactive Adobe XD prototypes available on request.
