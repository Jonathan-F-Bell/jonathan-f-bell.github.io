This has been an ongoing freelance web project.

It started in August 2019 when I took over a redesign of Indev.com from a previous designer, completed the WordPress based redesign, and then worked with Indev's hosting provider to transition to the new redesign.
I have since managed the content and design changes on the site.

Recently, I completed a project to move Indev.com to a new hosting provider for added speed and security, which included manually transferring the website, WordPress install, and it's data, updating the site and it's plugins, fixing issues that arose from this transfer, updating DNS records, transferring the domain name, installing a security certificate, and setting up a dynamic cache and Cloudflare CDN.
